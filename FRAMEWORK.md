This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

üîé **Nx is a set of Extensible Dev Tools for Monorepos.**

## Creating a new module

### command

Run `nest g resource resource-name` in the folder you want to insert it

choose `REST API` from the available options.

To extend the modules:

### Entity

Go to `entity/resource-name.entity.ts`

add teh @Entity() class decorator to the entity.

extend `BcBaseEntity<T>` with the current class type:

```js
import { Entity } from 'typeorm';
import { BcBaseEntity } from '@api';

@Entity()
export class Profile extends BcBaseEntity<Profile> {}
```

### Service

Go to to: `resource-name.service.ts`

Delete all the existing methods.

Extend the service to DataService. There are two generic types to add, the base Entity (ResourceName) and MongoRepository<UserName>:
`extends DataService<Profile, MongoRepository<Profile>>`

implement the constructor from with the appropriate injected service (see user.service.ts)

```js
 constructor(
  @InjectRepository(ResourceName)
  userRepository: MongoRepository<ResourceName>,
  logger: PinoLogger
) {
  super(userRepository, new ResourceBane(), logger);
}
```

### Controller

go to: `resource-name.controller.ts`

find all the +id in the service, and delete the `+`

### Module

Go to: `resource-name.module.ts`
s
add the module imports line:

```js

@Module[{
  ...
  imports: [..., ResourceNameModule],
  ...
}]

### Tests

follow the example in the user packages
```

If you get an error when nest starts one of the above steps was missed.

```
@Module({
// this is the entity
imports: [TypeOrmModule.forFeature([ResourceName)]],
controllers: [ResourceNameController],
providers: [ResourceNameService],
})
export class ProfileModule {}


```

## App Module

go too `app.module` (located in the src root of the project)`

add the module to the list of imports there.

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [React](https://reactjs.org)
    - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
    - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/web`
- [Angular](https://angular.io)
    - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/angular`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
    - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
    - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
    - `npm install --save-dev @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/nx-community) you could add.

## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@mediashare/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
